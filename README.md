# üñêÔ∏è Introduction

Hello! I am Johannes Schaefer, a passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on web development and a great enthusiasm for innovative technologies. My career goal is to further deepen my skills in frontend development and gain experience in backend development, ultimately working as a team leader in an agile Scrum team or taking on the role of a Product Owner.

My interest in IT, particularly web development, was sparked during my teacher training when I planned a project: the development of an application that could revolutionize the education system. This app was intended to help combat teacher shortages and make education more economical and effective. This drive to develop a solution to a real-world problem and bring it to perfection motivated me to shift my career to IT.

During my training as a frontend developer at the Developer Academy, I acquired solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT and Bootstrap and am currently working on developing a web app that optimizes the organization of team work processes. My ability to combine technical knowledge with leadership skills has already proven valuable during my time as a teaching student and in my role as a group leader. I aim to further expand these skills by taking on responsibilities in IT projects and deepening my knowledge in areas such as backend development, data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), DevOps, and cloud computing.

I am committed to driving projects forward efficiently and purposefully, with a clear focus on teamwork, quality, and innovation. The opportunity to work at the intersection of technology and team leadership and to bring projects from conception to perfection excites me the most.
